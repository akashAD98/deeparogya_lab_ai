Note:  
1,  Since  HbA1c reflects long term fluctuation in  the blood  glucose concentration  , a  diabetic patient who  is recently  under  
good control may still have  a high concentration of HbA1c  .  Converse  is  true  for a diabetic previously  under good control  
but now proply controlled.  
2, Target goals of <7.0% may be beneficial in patients with short duration of diabetes , long life expectancy and no  
significant cardiovascular disease. In patients with significant complications of diabetes ,limit life expectancy or extensive co-  
morbid conditions, targeting a goal of <7.0 % may not be appropriate.  

Comment :  
HBA1c provides an index of average blood glucose levels over the past 8 â 12 weeks and is a much better indicator of long  
term  glycemic control as compared to blood and urinary glucose  determinations.

Interpretation  (In  accordance  with  the  American  diabetes  association  guidelines):  
Â·  A fasting plasma glucose level below 110 mg/dL is considered normal.  
Â·  A fasting plasma glucose level between 100-126 mg/dL is considered as glucose intolerant or pre diabetic. A fasting and  
post-prandial blood sugar test (after consumption of 75 gm of glucose) is recommended for all such patients.  
Â·  A fasting plasma glucose level of above 126 mg/dL is highly suggestive of a diabetic state. A repeat fasting test is  
strongly recommended for all such patients. A fasting plasma glucose level in excess of 126 mg/dL on both the occasions is  
confirmatory of a diabetic state.

Interpretation:-  Kidney blood tests, or Kidney function tests, are used to detect and diagnose disease of the Kidney.  

The higher the blood levels of urea and creatinine, the less well the kidneys are working.  
The level of creatinine is usually used as a marker as to the severity of kidney failure. (Creatinine in itself is not harmful, but a high  
level indicates that the kidneys are not working properly. So, many other waste products will not be cleared out of the  
bloodstream.) You normally need treatment with dialysis if the level of creatinine goes higher than a certain value.  
Dehydration  can also be a come for increases in urea level.  
Before and after starting treatment with certain medicines. Some medicines occasionally cause kidney damage (Nephrotoxic Drug)  
as a side-effect. Therefore, kidney function is often checked before and after starting treatment with certain medicines.

  Interpretation:- Liver blood tests, or liver function tests, are used to detect and diagnose disease or inflammation of the liver.  
  Elevated aminotransferase (ALT, AST) levels are measured as well as alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and bilirubin. Some  
  diseases that cause abnormal levels of ALT and AST include hepatitis A, B, and C, cirrhosis, iron overload, and Tylenol liver  
  damage. Medications also cause elevated liver enzymes. There are less common conditions and diseases that also cause elevated

Total iron-binding capacity  
The test measures the extent to which iron-binding sites in the serum can be saturated. Because the iron-binding sites in the serum  
are almost entirely dependent on circulating transferrin, this is really an indirect measurement of the amount of transferrin in the  
blood.  
Taken together with serum iron and percent transferrin saturation clinicians usually perform this test when they are concerned  
about anemia, iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. However, because the liver produces transferrin, liver function must be  
considered when performing this test. It can also be an indirect test of liver function, but is rarely used for this purpose  

Transferrin Saturation  
1g of transferrin can carry 1.43g of iron. Normally, iron saturation of transferrin (transferrin saturation) is between 10% and 50%.  
Because of its short half-life, transferrin values decrease more quickly in protein malnutrition states and should be taken into  
consideration while evaluating iron-deficiency states

    2nd  Trimester  0.20-3.00 uIU/mL  

    3rd Trimester  0.30-3.00 uIU/mL  
   INTERPRETATION-  
   1. Primary hyperthyroidism is accompanied by elevated serum T3 & T4 values along with depressed TSH level.  
   2 .Primary hypothyroidism is accompanied by depressed serum T3 and T4 values & elevated serum TSH levels.  
   3. Normal T4 levels accompanied by high T3 levels and low TSH are seen in patients with T3 thyrotoxicosis.  
   4. Normal or low T3 & high T4 levels indicate T4 thyrotoxicosis ( problem is conversion of T4 to T3)  
   5. Normal T3 & T4 along with low TSH indicate mild / subclinical HYPERTHYROIDISM .  
   6. Normal T3 & low T4 along with high TSH is seen in HYPOTHYROIDISM .  
   7. Normal T3 & T4 levels with high TSH indicate Mild / Subclinical HYPOTHYROIDISM .  
   8. Slightly elevated T3 levels may be found in pregnancy and in estrogen therapy while depressed levels may be  
   encountered in severe illness , malnutrition , renal failure and during therapy with drugs like propanolol.  
   9. Although elevated TSH levels are nearly always indicative of primary hypothroidism . rarely they can result from TSH  
   secreting pituitary tumours ( seconday hyperthyroidism )

   COMMENTS:  
   Assay results should be interpreted in context to the clinical condition and associated results of other investigations.  
   Previous treatment with corticosteroid therapy may result in lower TSH levels while thyroid hormone levels are normal.  
   Results are invalidated if the client has undergone a radionuclide scan within 7-14 days before the test. Abnormal thyroid  
   test findings often found in critically ill clients should be repeated after the critical nature of the condition is resolved.The  
   production, circulation, and disintegration of thyroid hormones are altered throughout the stages of pregnancy.  
   NOTE-TSH  levels  are  subject  to  circardian  variation,reaching  peak  levels  between  2-4AM  and  ninimum  between  6-10  PM.  The  variation  is  the  order  of  50%  hence  time  of  the  day  has  influence  on  the  
   measures  serum  TSH  concentration.Dose  and  time  of  drug  intake  also  influence  the  test  result.  Reference  ranges  are  from  Teitz  fundamental  of  clinical  chemistry  7th  ed.

 Comments  
 Vitamin B 12 along with folate is essential for DNA synthesis and myelin formation. Vitamin B 12 deficiency can be because  


 of nutritional deficiency, malabsorption and other gastrointestinal causes. The test is ordered primarily to help diagnose the cause  
 of macrocytic/ megaloblastic anemia.  


 Decreased levels are seen in:                                              Increased levels are seen in:          


 anaemia, normal near term pregnancy, vegetarianism, partial gastrectomy/  renal failure, hepatocelluar disorders,  
 ileal damage, celiac disease, with oral contraceptive use, parasitic      myeloproliferative disorders and at  
 competition, pancreatic deficiency, treated epilepsy, smoking,            times with excess supplementation of

  Lower-than-normal levels suggest a vitamin D deficiency. This condition can result from Lack of exposure to sunlight,Lack of adequate vitamin  
  D in the  diet, Liver  and kidney diseases and Malabsorption.  A vitamin  D deficiency may lead  to: *Low blood  calcium levels (hypocalcaemia)  
  *Thin or weak bones (rickets, osteoporosis and osteomalacia) *High levels of parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism) Total 25-  
  hydroxyvitamin D (D2 + D3) is the correct measure of Vitamin D status.Higher-than-normal levels suggest excess vitamin D, a condition called  
  hypervitaminosis D. It is usually caused by vitamin D in the form of doctor-prescribed dietary supplements. 95% of serum vitamin D is Vit D3.  
  D2 is only received from supplements.
